# Operators

1. **Assignment operator '='**

We use '=' to assign a value to a variable, i.e.
```python  
 x = 15
```

2. Comparison operators
  * **Equality '==' (double '=')**

That operator is used to check equality between two variables.
```python
	if x == y:
		# do something
```
  * **Inequality '!='**

  Used to check if two variables have different values.
```python
	if a != b:
		# do something
```
  **Greater than '>'**,
  
  **Greater or equal '>='**,
  
  **Lesser than '<'**,
  
  **Lesser or equal '<='**


3. Arithmetic operators:
  * Addition '+', 
  * Subtraction '-', 
  * Multiplication '*', 
  * Division '/' (forward slash)


Warning: Using single slash to divide numbers (integers)  produces a float, i.e.
```python
first = 10
second = 5
third = first / second
print(third)  # 2.0 (float, not integer!)
```
