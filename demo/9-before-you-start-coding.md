# Before you start coding

 1. There are four assignments - Hello World, Calculator, Todo App, and Fibonacci. They are split into three categories - *Must have*, *Should have* and *Nice to have*.

 2. Please start with assignments from the *Must have* category, then move to *Should have* and finally to *Nice to have*. 
 
 3. ***Must have* assignments are mandatory if you'd like to attend our Demo Workshop!**  
 
 3. Be sure your coding environment is properly set up (Python is installed and VS Code is configured)
 
 4. Think about your assignment - what you have to do? What Python elements will you use?
 
 5. If you are stuck don't worry - that's the naural state of all programers no mather their level. Just google your problem!
 
 
One more thing about googling - there is a very good site that provide help for all kind of programmers: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
Try to find solution there, and look for answers that have the highest points rates and are quite recent!
