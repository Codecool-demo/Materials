# Clean code  

* Variables should be nouns (either singular or plural)
* If the variable's name is longer than one word, use dashes '_' between words, i.e.:
```python
	very_clever_name = 'Bob'
```
* You can add comments to make your code easier to understand. A comment starts with hash '#' and is ignored by Python interpreter - it's only for us, humans :)
